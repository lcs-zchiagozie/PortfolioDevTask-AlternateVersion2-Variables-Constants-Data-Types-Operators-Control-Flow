 # Question 3
 
 In the old days, people used a machine to count the value of spare change:
 
 ![coin_sorter](coin_sorter.jpg "A coin sorter")
 
 Forget a dedicated coin-sorting machine - imagine that you are writing a cutting edge augmented-reality app that will count coins just by pointing the camara of your phone at a pile of coins spread out on a table.
 
 Create a variable called `valueOfDimes`. Set it to `0.10` .
 
 Create a variable called `dimeCount`. It will track the number of dimes. Select the most appropriate data type. You can choose how many dimes your app counted.

 Create a variable called `valueOfQuarters`. Set it to `0.25` .

 Create a variable called `quarterCount`. It will track the number of quarters. Select an appropriate data type. You can choose how many quarters your app counted.
 
 Now create a constant called `totalValueOfCoins` and initialize the constant using a single expression that accurately calculates the total value of all the coins.
 
 Finally, for each variable and constant, explain why you used a given data type. Use `print()` statements to do this.
