 # Question 2
 
 Imagine you have a side project making up ironic t-shirts and selling the designs online.
 
 Here is an example of your work:
 
 ![ironic-t-shirt](ironic-t-shirt.jpg "An ironic t-shirt")
 
 You want to keep track of the sales numbers for each t-shirt design that you come up with.
 
 Create and initialize a variable or constant (whatever is more appropriate), using a reasonable data type, to represent each of these items:
 
 * a name for the t-shirt design
 * number of t-shirts sold
 * suggested selling price per t-shirt
 
 */
// Answer question 2 below
var numberOfTshirtsSold = 50
let tshirtDesign = "Baraka"
var suggestedSellingPricePerTshirt = 25
