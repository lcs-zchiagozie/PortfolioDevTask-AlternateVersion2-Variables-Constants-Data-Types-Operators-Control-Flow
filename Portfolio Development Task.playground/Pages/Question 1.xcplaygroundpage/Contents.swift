 # Question 1

 You take a part-time job over the Christmas Break to earn some spending money.
 
 You want to:
 
 1. keep track of your total earnings
 2. convert earnings to Canadian dollars so you have a sense of what you can afford when you get back to Lakefield
 
 For this question:
 
 * where necessary, change the variable names so they are more descriptive of what they keep track of
 * revise all variable names to use the camel case convention
 
 */
// Answer question 1 below
var whatthejobpaysmeperhourinhongkongdollars = 40.0
var hoursworkedoverbreak = 37.5
let e = whatthejobpaysmeperhourinhongkongdollars * hoursworkedoverbreak
let exchangerate = 0.16 // 1 Hong Kong dollar currently equals 0.16 of a Canadian dollar
let cda = e * exchangerate
